# SpectralInterpolation
Spectral Interpolation methods using Chebyshev polynomial. Code in MATLAB for 1D, 2D and 3D functions.

Each folder contains a README with relevant information.

Still in progress.

TODO

- Multilinear form expression for evaluating functions, for 3D function.
- Check the matlab X-Y row-column inverted storing "bug".
- Check that it works with Octave. (it should)
- Performance compared to linear
